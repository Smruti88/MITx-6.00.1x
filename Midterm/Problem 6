Write a function to flatten a list. The list contains other lists, strings, or ints. For example, [[1,'a',['cat'],2],[[[3]],'dog'],4,5] is flattened into [1,'a','cat',2,3,'dog',4,5] (order matters).

def flatten(aList):
    ''' 
    aList: a list 
    Returns a copy of aList, which is a flattened version of aList 
    '''
